# Mathematical Statistics, Time Series Analysis
Solutions to the labs and project of the course FMSN45 in LTH. Some of the topics are: Studies of ARMA-processes. Non-stationary models, slowly decreasing dependence. Transformations. Optimal prediction and reconstruction of processes. State representation, principle of orthogonality, and Kalman filtering. Parameter estimation: Least squares and Maximum likelihood methods as well as recursive and adaptive variants. Non-parametric methods,covariance estimation, spectral estimation. An orientation on robust methods and detection of outliers.

## Project
In particular, you find our solution to the interesting (and rather tough for that matter) project in [FMSN45/CourseMaterial/Code/ProjFinal/](https://github.com/AliBakly/FMSN45/tree/master/CourseMaterial/Code/ProjFinal).
